# Waku-Waku: Decentralized Uptime Monitoring Platform
### Website owners constantly worry about the uptime and performance of their websites, as downtime or slow response times can lead to revenue loss and poor user experience. Traditional monitoring solutions rely on centralized infrastructure, which can be limited in geographic coverage, prone to single points of failure, and expensive.

# Overview
Waku-Waku is a decentralized uptime monitoring platform that leverages a global network of validators running on public infrastructure. This platform monitors website availability every 3 minutes from various locations worldwide, providing real-time latency and response time analytics to website owners. Validators contribute their idle resources to perform these checks and are rewarded with small amounts of SOL for their participation.

# This decentralized approach ensures:

Greater reliability: No single point of failure.
Wider coverage: Validators from around the globe monitor websites.
Cost efficiency: Affordable for website owners and rewarding for validators.
